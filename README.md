# DarshanLadRepository

This is my repository containing all the codes of different tasks that have been assigned to us till now.

The first task was just simple introduction on how Git and Github works, learning how to pull request or commit changes.

The second task was covering object oriented programming in python, like inheritance, classes and objects. 
We worked on a company whose employees were of two types, engineers and salesperson, and our task was to implement 
the concepts that we learnt that week through videos. 'people.py' and 'TASK2-main.py' along with the readme file for
Task 2 has been uploaded for reference.

The third task was coding multi armed bandits. We were tasked with testing different types of algorithms to be used for bandits,
like epsilon greedy, ucb, klucb, thompson, and plotting graphs showing regret and reward for each algorithm. The readme file along with 
'base.py' , 'epsilon_greedy.py' , 'klucb.py' , 'ucb.py' , 'thompson.py' and 'TASK3-main.py' has been provided for reference.
